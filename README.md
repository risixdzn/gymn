<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## 💻 Run locally

As the database schema is kinda complex, having lots of relations and internal postgres scripts, you should just use the app at <a href='https://gymn.vercel.app'>https://gymn.vercel.app</a> and avoid having mental issues 🤣

## 🏋️ Usage

Gymn's purpose is to be used as a:

-   Workout tracking app
    -   Users can create and track their workout routine, creating their own workouts.
    -   They also can organize their favourite exercises.
-   Gym management app
    -   Gym owners accounts can create gyms and affiliate users
    -   The gym affiliate users have access to specific workout routines planned by their personal.
-   Gym social media
    -   All of this can be shared via posts
    -   You can have a profile and post your workout routine and inspire others to workout with you.
